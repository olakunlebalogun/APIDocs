            File upload is essentially the same term as <strong>upload</strong>, because most of the time data are
            transmitted
            as a structural unit known as a <strong>file</strong>.

            Note:
        </strong>

        <div class="mt-2">File names are not case-sensitive; that is, File_Name and file_name are considered identical.
            Two files cannot
            have
            the same name in a given folder.

            <p class="mt-2">
                By default, if a file with the same name exists in the target destination, the uploaded file replaces
                the
                existing
                file as a new revision.
