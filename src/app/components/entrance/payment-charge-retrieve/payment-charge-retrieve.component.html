    <h5>Payment Charge Retrieval</h5>
    <p>This is the endpoint responsible for calculating the charges associated with the transaction amount.</p>

    <div>
      <strong>
        Calculating The Charges
      </strong>
      <p>
        The endpoint takes only two parameters, namely :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The transaction amount : this is the amount the merchant is willing to borrow.
        </li>
        <li>
          Period: The maximum number of month(s) the said amount will be paid back.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For instance, if the amount is <b>#1000</b>, and the <strong>charges</strong> will be 15% of the amount.
        Therefore, the <strong>total amount</strong> to be paid back will be <b>#1150</b>
        <br>
        i.e <b>115%</b>.
      </p>

      <p>Below shows an example of the request parameter in the terminal:</p>
      <app-section-three [content]="contOne" [heading]="headOne"></app-section-three>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-3">
